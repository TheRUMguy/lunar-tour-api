# Serverless GraphQL NodeJS Starter

This is a basic boilerplate to kitstart your Serverless GraphQL projects with AWS Lambda. 

It is powered by `Apollo-Server-Lambda` and uses the Serverless Framework to deploy it to AWS.

This is hugely inspired by the starter that Anomaly Innovations created. The project was cloned from it. 

## Prerequistes
