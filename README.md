# Serverless GraphQL NodeJS Starter

This is a basic boilerplate to kitstart your Serverless GraphQL projects with AWS Lambda. 

It is powered by `Apollo-Server-Lambda` and uses the Serverless Framework to deploy it to AWS.

This is hugely inspired by the starter that Anomaly Innovations created. The project was cloned from it. 

## Prerequistes 

* An AWS Account
* [A configured AWS CLI](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)
* [Serverless Framework installed on your machine](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
* [NodeJS](nodejs.org) 

Note this project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). 

## How to get started

First clone the repo:

```

```

Move into the project folder:

```

```

Then Install all its dependancies:

```

```

Then you should be able to invoke the Lambda locally:

```

```

To deploy to AWS run the following command:

```

```

This should be a good start to be able to move on and do whatever you gotta do meet business requirements.
